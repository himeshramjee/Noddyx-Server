      Community Gardening 
      <p>Born out of my lack of knowledge around landscaping and maintaining a garden. 
      This is a portal and app for neighbourhoods to sign up and drive community wide gardening. 
      This will include integration with smart devices that for example can help track rainfall, level of sunshine. 
      These would feed into the portal and individual garden profiles. 
      Gardeners can then leverage the community to make informed decisions on building and maintaining their gardens.
      Gardens can opt-in to growing food to support the surrounding communities.</p>

    <li>
      Who's free? 
      <p>App that helps small groups of people (like our LiveLifeCT group!) get together more often. 
      Specifically around making the coordination and planning around it stress free.</p>

      Open Street Maps
      <p>Curious to play with this framework and compare with Google Maps. 
      Check out <a href="https://switch2osm.org/why-switch/" target="_blank">Switch to OSM</a></p>

    <li>
      R(eactive)Socket - service to service communications binary protocol (<a href="https://rsocket.io/" target="_blank">rsocket.io</a>)
      <p>Never heard of this before, looks really interesting (e.g. backpressure solution is built in). My gut tells me I'll be using this framework someday soon (probably in the IoT world).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      Garage Sale App
      <p>Simple app to help sell your stuff. Inventory/Item management, payments integration, item bid/reservation, viewing appointment scheduling and announcements. Virtual or not.</p>

      Teach Alexa about load-shedding shedules
      <p>
        Living in South Africa, we're painfully aware of living with water and electricity constraints.
        For electricity, there are various mobile apps that provide us with the schedule that is published by the main provider, Eskom.
        Alexa doesn't have that skill right now so this is a great option for me to to dig into Alexa skills.

      Kotlin
      <p>
        'cos I gotta put something recognizable on my resume! hehe, nah. I've heard some great things about Kotlin and developer productivity (e.g. promises to be way more succint than Java). 
        It seems like the language is evolving much faster than Java too.</p>
