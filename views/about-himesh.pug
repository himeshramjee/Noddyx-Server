          I am a 37 year old man living in Cape Town, South Africa. I've got around 13 years of 
          experience in the tech industry. Majority of my time as a Software Engineer (incl. Tech Lead and
          Solutions Architect roles) was spent in the online retail space. I recently left my day job at Amazon Web 
          Services after spending 4 years there as a Software Development Manager. I gained a massive amount of 
          experience during that time. I worked with fellow SDMs and teams of engineers in operating and growing 
          one of the biggest web services in our industry, AWS EC2. Right here in Cape Town, South Africa. :)

      h6(id="heading-who-am-i") Who am I?   
      p.
        I am currently based in Cape Town, South Africa. My wife and I have 2 amazing kids that are 
        growing so fast (not fast enough on some days! #joysofparenting). I’ve spent my career in the 
        technology industry which spans about 13 years and 3 significant roles. I started off as a 
        Software Developer then became a Solution Architect and recently clocked/celebrated 4 years 
        as a Software Development Manager.
      h6(id="heading-whats-important") What is important to me?
      p.
        Focus on growing with my young family, giving them as many new experiences as I can and 
        using technology to improve our day to day lives. I see Transparency and Integrity as 
        some of the 1st principles that I often lean on in making decisions. Curiosity, Candor and 
        Pragmatism keep me in my happy space and help me get things done.
      h6(id="heading-what-am-i-doing") What am I doing?
      p.
        My career motivations come from helping people/teams grow around technology and gaining 
        mastery over whatever I choose to do. Ideally, my next team would afford me the opportunity 
        to drive both areas. I'm a strong believer in Automation from Day 1 but also never hesitate 
        to roll up my sleeves and do the grunt work to get things done. I’ve also always had a tinkering/maker 
        mindset and sense of curiosity but I've' only ever explored it as a hobby. I recently dusted off my 
        Arduino kit and assembled a range sensor to account for the lack of front park distance control 
        on my bakkie. It was great picking that up again.
      h6(id="heading-whats-next") Whats next?
      p.
        I am looking to join teams that are making strides in human/personal technologies that improve 
        the day to day efforts of individual lives. This applies to technology in any industry but right 
        now I am excited about developing solutions in intelligence and automation involving both hardware and cloud 
        software. I don’t know the buzzwords around these but practically I think I’d get this from joining 
        teams like Amazon Alexa, Google Home and smaller teams that are building on open platforms like 
        Arduino or Rasberry PI.

        Real world experiene in Enterprise Architecture, Distributed Systems, Web Applications mainly stemming 
        from my days as an Tech lead and Architect in the online retail space and as an SDM with AWS EC2. At AWS EC2, 
        my core focus was on the growth of engineers in my team and our organisation, tracking my teams operational 
        costs and hygeine and participating in regular Systems Architecture discussions. During that time I 
        occasionally wrote bash and python scripts to get stuff done. e.g. write semi-automated tests to help sign 
        off on feature launches or do some infrastructure/service fleet maintenance or collate data on my 
        infrastructure footprint to help complete periodic reports. I always gravitated towards automating various 
        parts of my day job but getting to write some code was a challenge in the SDM role. Being able to write 
        scripts was something I always looked out for.

        2019 proved to be a really difficult time for my wife and I in balancing a toddler and a new 
        born baby along with our high pressure work environments. My wife Tershia is an Attorney/Lawyer. 
        By Q3 2019 we made the decision to slow down and give our kids the focus and attention they 
        were demanding. We've both been fortunate in our careers thus far and were able to make the 
        decision for her to stop working and become a stay at home mom. But that's easier said than done, 
        especially for an Attorney so she had a long lead time. Life has interesting ways of playing 
        out once decisions are made. I was able to follow suite much quicker and left Amazon to focus 
        on our family. Our lives have improved, our children are...well still just kids! :) Honestly, 
        I have really missed having a daily schedule and engaging with like minded technical people but 
        nothing compares with the freedom of being with your kids. I've been home for months now and 
        my wife is a month away from joining me and I'm keen to start my next adventure in tech, on 
        our terms. More about that in the About me section.

      p.
        In 2015 I took the opportunity to join Amazon Web Services (AWS) also as a Software Development 
        Manager (SDM). I spent 4 years in a highly challenging role and have come out with a tremendous 
        amount of tactical and tacit knowledge around operating (arguably?) the biggest Web Service in 
        the world, the EC2 APIs. During my time at AWS EC2, I worked with a small peer group of SDMs 
        with each of us owning a set of internal and external services that make up the EC2 APIs. I managed 
        around four engineering service teams over that time, and we were responsible for numerous tools 
        and services.

        Reported to the CTO. Initially responsible for both Mr Delivery Courier & Mr Delivery Food 
        engineering teams. The Food systems had not received sufficient investment prior, they were outdated
        and operationally highly unstable. Worked with engineers, Technical Project Manager and the Head of
        Business to stabilize daily operations and put together a roadmap plan for rebuilding the stack from
        the ground up. Introduced basic monitoring (New Relic), which helped identify and resolve major
        inefficiencies in the system. Developed the high-level architecture and migration plan that would
        guide the build of the new stack. It was modelled on distributed microservices architecture and a
        mobile first development approach along with RESTful APIs. Built python scripts to automate
        infrastructure provisioning in AWS. It allowed Dev, Pre-Prod & Prod to be spun up or torn down
        automatically. This served as a proof of concept to explore the costs of AWS, as an anchor point for
        learning AWS technology and an initial cost saving function in day to day development.

      p.
        Majority of my career as a Software Engineer was spent with what was the largest online retailer 
        in South Africa, kalahari.com. I started my role there as a junior engineer and quickly made my 
        way up to Team Lead and then Solution Architect. 

      h5 Starting with kalahari.net
      p.
        At kalahari.com, we worked within small teams, 3-5 service engineers, 1 QA engineer, 1 scrum master. 
        We also regularly engaged with Product Owners, Business Analysts and UX design teams. Looking back, 
        I really appreciate the diversity of people I got to grow with. I'm wiser today and can honestly look 
        back and be astonished at how much the teams and business felt like family. We were highly effective 
        teams and making huge strides in improving the systems we owned and in keeping our customers satisfied. 
        Initially, all of kalahari.nets' systems were built and maintained in house. When I joined the business, 
        they were kicking off a modernisation project to move from classic ASP.net to .NET. I was given my first 
        Tech Lead role in building a system called the (website) Navigation Manager. It was made up of a Website 
        and a Windows Communication Foundation service. The modernisation project took a couple years to complete 
        but was an overall success. 

      h5 Growing into kalahari.com
      p.
        However, it wasn't long there after that our leadership decided to spin up a "Replatforming" project. 
        The project involved moving the entire business onto a commercial enterprise level ecommerce in a box 
        solution called Hybris. The Hybris solution, which was bought by SAP last I checked, is written in Java 
        and I raised my hand to move into 1 of the new teams being formed around the project. That's when my 
        journey in Java, Spring Framework and Enterprise systems began. As we worked to rewrite kalahari.com, 
        we each grew with the business and I eventually moved into a senior position and became responsible for 
        a service team. My biggest change in moving to that role was the people management aspect. In hindsight 
        it was super light when compared to what I did in a similar role at AWS EC2. The business kept growing 
        fast and I started feeling the effects of that growth. To address that I pushed to become a Solution 
        Architect and in doing so have more of a voice in early new feature developement and in key technical 
        considerations that I felt were starting to lack.

        3fifteen was a Microsoft Gold Partner and a software consultancy business. This was my first exposure 
        to developing real world solutions. I got to work on various smaller projects that I honestly can't 
        recall today but one that does stand out was when I was a pseudo tech lead during one. I worked closely 
        with a Project/Account Manager to elicit requirements from our client and iteratively working through 
        the development process. This involved regular on-site meetings with the client where I would demo the 
        development progress I'd made (at least once a month).

        MCSE and MCSD certifications and also got to build an internal Windows Desktop Application for (IIRC) 
        the recruiting team. Insignificant now but I always look back at that experience in a fond way. It was 
        the first time I saw myself as a leader and took on the responsibility.
