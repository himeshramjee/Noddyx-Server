# Noddyx Server for Noddy land

# Noddy land??
Ye...naming is difficult. I needed a name for my hobby projects. My son was watching TV. Noddy Land was born. :)

## Anything interesting here?
Just a bunch of firsts for me in terms of exploring standard tech outside of Amazon EC2.

## Tech used to build this website
1. Visual Studio Code editor
1. Git
1. Docker
1. NodeJS (w/ Express and Pug)
1. PureCSS framework
1. Coming soon - AWS Cognito

## Where do you host this website?
Curently a non NodeJS static version of this website is hosted using AWS S3, CloudFront and Route 53.
   * Why? Cos it's the cheapest hosting option that includes TLS/SSL within AWS. I think.
   * Once I have some form of Auth in place I'll try and move away from hosting on S3.

## What else are you working on?
I've started listing personal projects on this website (more of a TODO list for me). Take a look at https://himesh.ramjee.co.za.
